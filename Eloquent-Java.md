#Eloquent JavaScript 2nd Edition

##Introduction

Programming language exist so that we can instruct computer how to accomplish a given task, and essentially act as an interface between how we understand commands and the binary language that a computer understands.

##Chapter 1

A value is a reserved collection of bits that represents some piece of information. There are 6 types of values: numbers, strings, Booleans, objects, functions, and undefined. A number value is exactly that: a number. A string value is a sequence of characters, with a "\" preceding special characters. Boolean values are "true" or "false", often generated through an operator comparing other values.

Operators are actions that are performed on values, such as the arithmetic operators. Unary operators only accept one value, binary operators accept 2 values, and ternary will accept 3 values.

JavaScript will engage in automatic type conversion of values if you are not careful, so be aware of how it may be interpreting the values when used with various operators.
